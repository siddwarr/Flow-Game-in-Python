# Flow-Game-in-Python
I have recreated the "Flow Free" game using pygame and tkinter in python.
Also created a user-friendly interface using Tkinter, incorporating user registration and login functionalities. 

You can start playing the game by running the login_file.py file
After registration you can start playing the game
You can also view your personal details after playing like highscore and time spent on each level

ENJOY!
